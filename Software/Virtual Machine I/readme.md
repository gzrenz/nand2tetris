# Virtual Machine I 

A virtual machine processes intermediate code and translates intermediate vm code into machine assembly code. 
The vm code comes from the compiled high level code via the compiler, because the 
Jack language is compiled into vm code, which can be accessed by the machine through
a vm implementation. This allows cross platform accesibility similar to Java.
