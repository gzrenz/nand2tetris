# nand2tetris

The nand2tetris course is based on the book "Elements of Computing Systems" by Noam Nisan and Shimon Schocken. To learn more about nand2tetris, visit https://www.nand2tetris.org/

## Scope 

* Hardware: Boolean arithmetic, combinational logic, sequential logic,
design and implementation of logic gates, multiplexers, flip-flops,
registers, RAM units, counters, Hardware Description Language (HDL),
chip simulation, verification and testing.
* Architecture: ALU/CPU design and implementation, clocks and cycles,
addressing modes, fetch and execute logic, instruction set, memory-
mapped input/output.
* Low-level languages: Design and implementation of a simple machine
language (binary and symbolic), instruction sets, assembly programming,
assemblers.
* Virtual machines: Stack-based automata, stack arithmetic, function call
and return, handling recursion, design and implementation of a simple
VM language.
* High-level languages: Design and implementation of a simple object-
based, Java-like language: abstract data types, classes, constructors,
methods, scoping rules, syntax and semantics, references.
* Compilers: Lexical analysis, parsing, symbol tables, code generation,
implementation of arrays and objects, two-tier compilation.
* Programming: Implementation of an assembler, virtual machine, and
compiler, following supplied APIs. Can be done in any programming
language.
* Operating systems: Design and implementation of memory management,
math library, input/output drivers, string processing, textual output,
graphical output, high-level language support.
* Data structures and algorithms: Stacks, hash tables, lists, trees, arithmetic
algorithms, geometric algorithms, running time considerations.
* Software engineering: Modular design, the interface/implementation
paradigm, API design and documentation, unit testing, proactive test
planning, quality assurance, programming at the large.

## Parts 
The book is divided into two sections namely the hardware part and the software part. Each part comprises six chapters and six projects.
